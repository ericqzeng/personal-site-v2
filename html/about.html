                    As both a software developer and photographer, Eric seeks to find ways to constantly learn, grow, and create. He currently will be working for Captial One over the summer
                    in New York City but is always open to exploring new industries and places. As an avid fan of all things engineering, Eric has a fond interest in all things "techy", ranging
                    from software development, computer electronics, consumer devices, and even motorsports (he will talk to you all day about racing).
